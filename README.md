### Phonebook Application
This project creates a phonebook where the user can input the name, email, and number of a person and it will be stored within a database. The user will be able to edit and delete contacts. This application includes features that kindly guide the user to confirm and edits or deletion or contacts while having a window activated when the user tries to close the app to confirm said action. 
### Student Tracking Application
This application is very similar to the Phonebook Application. This app allows the user to input the student's name, email, and the current course that they are taking. All of this data is transferred into a database. Users are able to edit and delete the student information using the buttons provided, while having windows come up that asks them to confirm their action. 
### Nice or Mean Game
